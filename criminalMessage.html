        A government agency has learned that a criminal organization is using Reddit to communicate. To keep from being detected, the criminals are posting 
        comments that look innocuous but use a secret pattern: One or more digits followed by any number of characters, followed by the word "star". However, 
        the letters in the word "star" may be separated by a single space. Ex: "starring", "blast ark", and "st a r" are all legitimate ways of including the 
        word "star" in a posting.

        Loop through the Reddit posts in the posts array and output to the console the lines that match the criminal's pattern. Use a single regex to identify 
        the suspected posts. Hint: The 2nd, 3rd, and 5th lines should match the regex.

        The regex should match uppercase or lowercase letters. To create a case-insensitive regex, place the letter "i" at the end of the regex. 
        Ex: /myRegex/i matches "myregex" and "MYregEX".
